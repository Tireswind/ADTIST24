# Automated Detection of Tropes In Short Texts
To better persuade audiences, individuals often make use of tropes, i.e., recurring narrative elements that rely on familiar patterns, such as the “smoking gun” or the “veil of secrecy” in movies. Tropes tend however to oversimplify complex issues and manipulate information, thus making their identification an effective mean for understanding the potential biases inherent in public discourse. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of automatically detecting general tropes that are often used in the context of discussions on social media platforms. We start by formulating the task and discussing how it differs from previous work. We then create a ground truth dataset of vaccine and immigration-related social media posts manually labeled with tropes occurring in these domains. Next, we develop a supervised machine learning technique for multi-label classification using this ground truth, fine-tune the model for improved trope detection, and show its effectiveness experimentally. Our experimental results show that tropes are used across different domains, and fine-tuned models are able to detect them with high accuracy.
